## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Inter)

### What I learned

This project helped me practice:

1. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Used Flexbox for centering and layout control
2. **Custom CSS Properties**: Implemented the color scheme using HSL values
3. **Hover States**: Created smooth transitions for interactive elements
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the design works on both mobile and desktop
5. **Accessibility**: Used semantic HTML and proper focus states

Key CSS techniques used:

```css
.social-link:hover,
.social-link:focus {
  background-color: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  outline: none;
}
```

```css
.profile-card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 40px;
  text-align: center;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 384px;
}
```

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on:

- Advanced CSS animations and transitions
- CSS Grid for more complex layouts
- Accessibility best practices
- Performance optimization
